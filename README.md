# Black Jack
Classic card game where the goal is to reach 21 without going over.

Face cards are worth 10 and aces are worth 11.  Aces in real black jack can be worth 11 or 1 but in my game I haven't figured out that logic yet so that will have to come in a later update.  There is a button to start a new game and the dealer plays when you decide to stay.  

The dealer is programmed to hit until he has 16 or more (and less than 22 of course)
